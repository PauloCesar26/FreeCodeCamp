//OOP: 
    //"class" is like a blueprint for creating objects
        //It allows you to define a set of properties and methods, and instantiate 
        // (or create) new objects with those properties and methods

    //class have a special "constructor" method, which is called when a new 
    //instance of the class is created
        //the constructor method is great place to initialize properties of the class

    //The "this" keyword is JS is used to refer to the current object
        //depending on where this is used, what it references changes
        //in the case of a class, it refers to the instacne of the object being constructed
        //can use the this keyword to set the properties of the object being instantiated
        //can say that "this" is a reference of current object
