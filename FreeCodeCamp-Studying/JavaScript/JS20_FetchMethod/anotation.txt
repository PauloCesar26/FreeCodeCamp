- API = Application Programming Interface
- API lets people from outside of an organization retrieve it's internal data

- Method called "fetch" that allows code to receive data from an API by sending a GET request
    - The fetch return a "Promise", which is a placeholder object that will either be fulfilled 
    if your request is successfull, ou rejected if youer request is unsuccessful

    - If the promise is fulfilled, it resolves to a "Response" object, and you can use the ".then()"
    method to access the "Response"

    - The data you get from a "GET" request is not usable at first, to make usable, can use the 
    ".json()" method on the "Response" object to parse it into JSON

    - The ".catch()" method is another asynchronous JS method you cna use to handle error.
    This is useful in case the "Promise" gets rejected
